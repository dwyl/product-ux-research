# Product UI/UX Research

A place to collect, sort and discuss UI/UX inspiration from various sources.
As described in our 
[Product Roadmap](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap)
there are _many_ "productivity" Apps 
that **_partially_ solve** the problem we face.
None of them is a _complete_ solution 
which is _why_ we are building our own App.

This repository is intended to capture any User Interface, Experience or Interaction
we find relevant to the App we are building.
If you spot a great Micro-interaction in an App that you use,
or you see an App that looks really good, share it!

Please open issues! Share screenshots, links, videos and disucss!
